# DFSFileCleaver
This is a tool to split Acorn DFS double sided images to two single sided images, or to combine two single sided images to a double sided image.<br>

This has been broken away from Disc Image Manager as a separate tool. You can find Disc Image Manager here: https://github.com/geraldholdsworth/DiscImageManager<br>
